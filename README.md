## Background

PyBank

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. With the use of a set of financial data called budget_data.csv.

Tasked with creating a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll

In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

I used a set of poll data called election_data.csv, which was provided. Tasked to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote
